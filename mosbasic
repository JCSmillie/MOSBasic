#  Easy to use command line tools for interacting with MOSYLE MDM.  In 
#  places I also will interact with IncidentIQ ticket system for data.  
#  I'm going to try to run my inventory check module so anyone could 
#  easily write their own module for the ticket system they use.  Will
#  post a note about that in the wiki later when we get there.
#
# This file is the CLI binder.  Its just to establish our basic command (mosbasic)
# and link up all of its abillities.  Each ability gets a sub file in ./commands
